## Ideas
- File encryption using various algorithms
- Start by getting a working program with an easy algorithm and then
  move on to the more secure (but also more complex) algorithms
- Use UNIX pipes and std streams only
- Prioritize being useful to both humans but also other programs

## Algorithms
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- Caesar's Cipher
